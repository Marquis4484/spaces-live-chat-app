# Spaces: Real Time Chat App




## An Live Messaging Chat Made Possible with WebSockets

Spaces is a live messagging chat application that I created in React and is powered by Socket.io. The fronted portion of the app utilizes popular react concepts such as React Hooks and React Context API in order to manage state and send data throughout the entirety of this program. The backend portion of this site was created with Nodejs, Expressjs, and Socket.io. Socket.io is especially important because it allows for bi-directional communication between users to occur within the app. Once users create a profile and sign-in, they are able to chat with one another as much as they please. 

## Purpose of this Project 

I wanted to build something that would make use WebSocket technology. WebSockets are an interesting topic that I have never tackled before this application.
